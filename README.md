## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

One challenge I faced was with the specific wording of some password keys.
I felt frustrated and was stuck going from challenge 2 to challenge 3.
After taking a break, I was able to figure out the password and breezed through the rest of the assignment.
